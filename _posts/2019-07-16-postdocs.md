The [Supertech research group](http://supertech.csail.mit.edu) in the
[Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory](http://www.csail.mit.edu) at the [Massachusetts Institute
of Technology](http://web.mit.edu/), under the direction of [Professor
Charles E. Leiserson](https://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/), seeks to
hire postdoctoral associates to assist in establishing and developing
the open-source [OpenCilk](http://www.opencilk.org) parallel-computing
platform, which is based on the [Tapir/LLVM
compiler](https://doi.org/10.1145/3018743.3018758) and the Cheetah
work-stealing runtime system.  Recent Ph.D. graduates in computer
science and engineering are sought.  Candidates should have
backgrounds and publication records in one or more of the following
areas:

- parallel computing (particularly multicore); 
- compilers (especially LLVM) and runtime systems;
- software performance engineering (writing fast code);
- algorithms and data structures;
- scientific, graph, and machine-learning libraries;
- software engineering, testing, and release management;
- cloud environments and operating systems;
- productivity tools;
- user interface design and implementation.

Experience with upstreaming modifications to large open-source
software projects is a plus.  These positions carry no teaching
obligations, although teaching opportunities are a possibility for
those interested.  Candidates should be prepared to manage
undergraduate- and Masters-level research.  Prospective candidates
should email a brief statement of interest to TB Schardl at
neboat@mit.edu.  Please attach your CV, two research papers, a list of
three references, and a sample of your code.
